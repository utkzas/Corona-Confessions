## Inspiration
Social Isolation has led to depression, stress and tension among numerous people. Just Scrolling Insta feed or Watching Netflix whole day cannot replace the happiness we had when we were together. Some feeling cannot be confessed with friends, families and partners. So here we built a Corona Confessions App specially dedicated to cater needs of Corona Lockdown

## What it does
It solves the problem of Social Isolation worldwide.
Strangers can talk and confess their feelings freely. Nobody is here to judge them.
We can build new connections, find new friends and can even ask for help.
Smart Emojis make chatting more interesting
Super fast and instant message transfer powered by Socket. io
See who's online when you login via PC or Laptop
Suicide Telephone Directory is also placed in the front page so that people can ask for help if someone's life is at stake

## How I built it
I used React to build the Frontend and Socket. io for instant fast messaging. Node. JS was used as backend and Express as Node. JS Framework

## Challenges I ran into
I had a great trouble setting up socket. io as It was difficult to set up but finally, I did it.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I've built something for the society. No matter I win or lose, the self satisfaction of serving the society will remain in my mind & heart forever. I am proud that I learned about Socket.io and Node.JS for such a short span of time and now I can call myself Full Stack Developer (Hopefully) 
* It can go right easily to start up and can be improved further to recognise suicidal messages / intentions which will help prevent Suicide. It needs Low Funding and can prove to be a powerful app to serve Society.
* This app occupies people to talk with strangers, build new connections and spend their time in a productive way. Hence, will cause less Social-Interaction & reduce the impact of COVID-19 with a mobility! 


## What I learned
I finally learned Full Stack  Development by creating this app.  Earlier I had created a project in Full Stack and this is my second Successful App fully deployed and available for use for all !
 
## What's next for Corona Confessions
I will further expand this app with more functionalities like sending images, voice messages etc. I expect it to grow rapidly and then I will work harder on this
